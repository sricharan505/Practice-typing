Created a simple react application for users to improve their typing skill by practicing on this app.

First user has to enter the number of sentences they wish to type, then start typing in the textarea provided below, timer is started as soon as the first letter is typed and is display on the top right along with the Words per minute. When user finishes typing the sentence provided, a final result is provided with details like number of errors comitted, overall accuracy, WPM and total time taken.

I have used HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap and the Hipster API(https://hipsum.co/) for generating random sentences. The calculations on accuracy are based on this doc.(https://www.cbse.gov.in/cbsenew/documents//Typing%20Test%20Formula%20and%20Illustration.pdf).

Thank you.
